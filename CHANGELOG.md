### üöÄ Major Release - Plugin System Architecture

This release introduces a comprehensive plugin system architecture that fundamentally transforms how the G1 API Framework handles extensibility and modularity.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Plugin System Core Architecture**
  - New `PluginManager` class for centralized plugin lifecycle management
  - `PluginContext` interface providing file system operations, configuration access, and project metadata
  - Plugin registration, initialization, and execution pipeline
  - Support for plugin dependencies and ordering
  
- **Built-in Core Plugins**
  - **OpenAPI Plugin**: Automatic OpenAPI 3.0 specification generation and Scalar documentation UI
  - **Database Plugin**: Drizzle ORM integration with SQLite support and automatic migration handling
  - **Authentication Plugin**: JWT-based authentication with configurable providers
  - **Validation Plugin**: Zod-based request/response validation with automatic schema generation
  
- **Enhanced CLI Plugin Support**
  - `--openapi` flag for OpenAPI documentation generation
  - `--database` flag for database integration setup
  - `--auth` flag for authentication system setup
  - `--validation` flag for request validation setup
  - Plugin-aware project scaffolding and template generation

- **New Template System**
  - Plugin-aware project templates
  - Conditional file generation based on enabled plugins
  - Template inheritance and composition support
  - Dynamic configuration injection

### üîß Fixed
- **Dependency Management**
  - Replaced `fs-extra` with Node.js built-in `fs/promises` in core package
  - Fixed `fs.ensureDir` ‚Üí `fs.mkdir(..., { recursive: true })` migration
  - Fixed `fs.pathExists` ‚Üí `fs.access` with proper error handling
  - Resolved TypeScript build errors in OpenAPI and Pino logger modules

- **Type Safety Improvements**
  - Fixed `AppBindings` type compatibility issues
  - Added proper generic type parameters to Hook definitions
  - Resolved middleware type assertions and context handling
  - Enhanced error handling with proper type guards

### üí• Breaking Changes
- **Plugin System Integration**: Projects must now use the plugin system for advanced features
- **Template Structure**: Project templates have been restructured to support plugin-based generation
- **CLI Interface**: New plugin flags change the default project creation behavior
- **Core Dependencies**: Removed `fs-extra` dependency from core package (internal change)

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements
- Modular architecture enabling easier feature extension
- Improved separation of concerns between core framework and optional features
- Enhanced testability with plugin isolation
- Better performance through selective feature loading
- Comprehensive plugin testing and validation

### üì¶ Package Updates
- **@g-1/core**: `1.15.15` ‚Üí `2.0.0`
- **@g-1/cli**: `1.2.7` ‚Üí `2.0.0`
- **@g-1/util**: `1.0.2` ‚Üí `1.1.0`

### üîÑ Migration Guide
Existing projects can be migrated to use the new plugin system by:
1. Updating to the latest CLI version
2. Running `npx @g-1/cli migrate` (coming in next release)
3. Enabling desired plugins through CLI flags or configuration
