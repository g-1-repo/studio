# Changelog

## 1.15.13

### Patch Changes

- # Code Quality Improvements

  This release focuses on comprehensive code quality improvements across the framework:

  ## üîß Type Safety Enhancements

  - **Fixed all explicit `any` types** - Replaced with proper type definitions throughout the codebase
  - **Improved session and user typing** - Added proper interfaces for authentication bindings
  - **Enhanced OpenAPI hook types** - Replaced `any` with `unknown` for better type safety
  - **Environment parsing improvements** - Updated to use `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any`

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Code Style & Best Practices

  - **Removed useless constructors** - Eliminated redundant constructors that only called `super()`
  - **Added missing radix parameters** - Fixed all `parseInt()` calls to include explicit radix (base 10)
  - **Cleaned up imports** - Removed unused imports and dependencies
  - **Fixed non-null assertions** - Replaced with proper null checks and error handling

  ## üì¶ Affected Packages

  - **@g-1/core**: Security middleware, base repository, types, and OpenAPI utilities
  - **@g-1/templates**: Email template constructors and imports
  - **@g-1/boilerplate**: Environment parsing functions

  ## üéØ Impact

  - **Zero lint warnings** - Achieved perfect code quality standards
  - **Improved maintainability** - Better type safety and cleaner code structure
  - **Enhanced developer experience** - More predictable types and better error handling
  - **Future-proof codebase** - Follows modern TypeScript best practices

  All changes are backward compatible and maintain existing functionality while significantly improving code quality.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.12.5] - 2025-10-18

## Unreleased

### Added

- **API Versioning**: Complete implementation of API versioning with v1 route structure
  - Moved all API routes to versioned `/v1/` path structure
  - Reorganized early-access-requests routes under v1 namespace
  - Added versioned auth documentation routes
  - Enhanced route organization for better API evolution support

### Changed

  - Auth documentation moved to `/v1/auth-docs`
  - Index route reorganized under v1 structure
- **Test Updates**: Updated test files to work with new versioned API structure

### Developer Experience

- Improved API organization with clear versioning strategy
- Enhanced maintainability with structured route hierarchy
- Better support for future API evolution and backward compatibility

## [1.12.1] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed

- Fix TypeScript compilation errors in HTTP status handling

## [1.10.2] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed

- Add missing newlines at end of file (EOF) in test files to resolve ESLint errors.

### Performance

- Refactor app bootstrap in `src/lib/create-app.ts` to reduce per-request allocations (reused validation/CORS options, hoisted static HTML).
- Extract dashboard HTML to `src/lib/static/dashboard.ts` and serve constant string.
- Extract test helper routes to `src/lib/register-test-routes.ts`; always registered under `/__test__/*` and kept behind that prefix.
- Scope auth/session middleware to only `/api/*` and `/protected`.
- Gate API docs by env (`API_DOCS_ENABLED`) in `src/app.ts`.

### Database

- Add indexes: `sessions(userId)`, `verifications(identifier, expiresAt)`, `accounts(providerId,accountId,userId)`, `members(organizationId,userId)`.
- Optimize existence check in early-access repository to `select 1 limit 1`.

### Mail/Auth

- Lazy-load mail templates in auth flows to reduce cold-start time.

### Tooling

- Ignore `coverage/` in `.gitignore`.
- Lint and import-order fixes; typecheck clean.

## [1.10.1] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- Cookie-aware test helper (requestWithCookies, requestJSON/postJSON) to persist session cookies in tests.
- New tests: sign-out flow, protected route, email outbox, permissions (system and org), time-control with fake timers.
- Permissions middleware tests with org membership setup.
- TESTING.md with guidance and examples.

### Changed

- Removed test-only fallbacks from runtime; rely on session middleware and test helpers.
- Disabled pino logger during tests; Better Auth debugLogs only in development.
- Refactored all applicable tests to use cookie helpers.

### Fixed

- EarlyAccessRequestsRepository.findOneByEmail now returns null when not found (instead of undefined).
- Stabilized protected-route test by forwarding cookies.

### Documentation

- Enhanced top-level README with badges, quickstart, architecture diagram, and testing notes.
- Linked docs from scripts/README.md.

### CI

- Increased coverage thresholds (statements 36, branches 20, functions 28, lines 36).
